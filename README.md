### Reinforcement Learning implementations

This repositoty stores the implementations of some of the RL algorithms described and discussed in the following book:

Richard S. Sutton and Andrew C. Barto, Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction, 2nd edition, The MIT Press, 2018.

**Important:** This repository is still a WORK IN PROGRESS (and will probably forever be). Also, these codes have been written only for learning purposes and are probably not implemented in the most efficient way.
