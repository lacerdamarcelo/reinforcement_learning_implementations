"""
Implementation of the algorithm first-visit Monte Carlo control for estimation
of the optimal policy. Pseudocode in page 101 of the book "Reinforcement
Learning: an Instroduction", 2nd edition, by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G.
Barto. A few adaptations have been made in order to make it more efficient.
